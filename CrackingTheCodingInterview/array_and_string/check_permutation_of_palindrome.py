	Problem: Given a string, check if it is a permutation of palindromic String. The palindrome does not 
	need to be limited to just dictionary words. 

	Input: Tact Coa
	Output: True (permuatations: "taco cat")
'''

'''
	Approach 1: Get all permutation of a string and check for each if its a palindrome or not

	Time Complexity: O(n!) where n is the length of the string
'''

# TODO: Write a program to get all the permutation of a string


'''

	Approach 2: Store all the characters of a string in a hash map and then check in the hash map if any two characters comes 
	odd number of times, return False

	Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n)

	Any string of even length should have all even counts of characters in order to be a palindrome. A string of odd length should 
	have only one character with odd count. So we just need to make sure that there is only one such character. We can avoid one 
	loop in the above solution by counting the number of odd-even with each character value.
